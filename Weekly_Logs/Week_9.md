- I had started working on YOLOX Inference using openCV's Deep Neural Network framework <b>(cv.dnn)</b>. I began testing various models from the YOLOX repo including the legacy models. 
- For the project, we made use of the <b>YOLOX_S</b>, <b>YOLOX_tiny</b>, and <b>YOLOX_nano</b> version(s) of YOLOX model since it offers the following advantages over other models.

| Version | Resolution | mAPval (0.5:0.95) | FLOPS | Params | Model Size |
|:--------|:-----------|:------------------|:------|:-------|:-----------|
| YOLOX_S | 640*640 | 40.5 | 9.0 | 26.8 | 66.7 MB FP16 |
| YOLOX_Tiny | 416*416 | 25.3 | 0.91 | 1.08 | 40.8 MB FP16 |
| YOLOX_Nano | 416*416 | 32.8 | 5.06 | 6.45 | 7.7 MB FP16 |
	
- YOLOX is an anchor-free version of YOLO, with a simpler design but better performance! It aims to bridge the gap between research and industrial communities. We present some experienced improvements to YOLO series, forming a new high-performance detector -- YOLOX. We switch the YOLO detector to an anchor-free manner and conduct other advanced detection techniques, i.e., a decoupled head and the leading label assignment strategy SimOTA to achieve state-of-the-art results across a large scale range of models: For YOLO-Nano with only 0.91M parameters and 1.08G FLOPs, we get 25.3% AP on COCO, surpassing NanoDet by 1.8% AP; for YOLOv3, one of the most widely used detectors in industry, we boost it to 47.3% AP on COCO, outperforming the current best practice by 3.0% AP; for YOLOX-L with roughly the same amount of parameters as YOLOv4-CSP, YOLOv5-L, we achieve 50.0% AP on COCO at a speed of 68.9 FPS on Tesla V100, exceeding YOLOv5-L by 1.8% AP.

<b>WEEK3 TASKS</b>
- [x] Demonstrated <b>cv.dnn</b> inference of YoloX on test images from val2017 COCO dataset.[work](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qABb90X0mNBnEd8u1JBTvRiizvmZxIT2?usp=sharing)
- [x] Run benchmark of the model on COCO val2017 dataset and report the scores for Average Precision (AP) and Average Recall (AR), the results observed are shared below.

- This was the final week of GSoC, I have completed all the deliverables mentioned in the proposal. However, I am continuing my work with the organization since I like the work that the community is working on and also want to contribute further beyond the scope of GSoC. 
- I am assigned to work on COCO evaluation script for .ONNX models in the model zoo library, apart from this I have decided to work with the mentors and continue working with the organisation. 
- Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2022 has been a very fruitful experience, I had very basic open-source knowledge before enrolling in this program as a contributor. But the journey has taught me so many things and the importance of open-source. My work mainly focused on object detection models, I learned how different models work the architectures of models such as NanoDet, YOLOX and EfficientDet were really interesting to learn. 
- Most of the work that I had worked on as a contributor for openCV has furthered my interest in research and sparked a passion to contribute to more open-source developments. I was able to learn a lot and acquire experience working with open-source tools such as openVINO, onnxruntime and etc. 
- I was able to see how my contributions would be useful to the community. Being a contributor in the GSoC 2022 has been one of the best moments in my career so far. I only hope to continue contributing to other open-source repositories and learn a lot more after this amazing experience. I thank both Google and OpenCV organization for seeing something in me that I did not, thank you for giving me this opportunity, it really helped me a lot.
- I acquired new skills that will help me grow versatile and provident programmer in the domain of computer vision and deep learning. I was able to pick up working with large datasets and pick up using new packages that are crucial for object detection such as cv2.dnn, onnxruntime, etc. 

##### TO MY MENTORS
Thank you so much for trusting me that pushing me, I was able to work on exciting areas that aligned with my research interest. I was able to acquire new skills and also collaborate with amazing people in this organisation. I love the work this organisation has been contributing to the computer vision community, every computer vision enthusiast has been deeply involved with opencv tools and it makes me proud to have contributed to this amazing organisation working with such talented and skilled mentors who keep pursuing new technologies in the domain of computer vision. I hope to continue contributing to your organisation by working on more support for the OpenCV and OpenCV zoo repos such as COCO evaluation, API modules, etc.

Converted Pytorch model to ONNX format.
Generated Nanodet model ONNX format with FP16.
Loaded the ONNX formatted model using OpenCV.

#### Plan:
Create Pull requests before mid-review for inferring the model using OpenCV.
Test the inferred model using OpenCV on sample images. 
Work on creating a quantized version of the ONNX model. 

#### Issues:
Not able to run inference using "Net. forward() on OpenCV despite being able to load and read the model layers using 
OpenCV.
